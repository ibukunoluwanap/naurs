                            Now you may ask why Bay Avenue; It’s a big responsibility for one or parents to drive and
                            find parking and attend class especially its impossible for working parents to drop their kids in
                            a class wait and pick them back considering social distancing whereas the kids and grownups
                            can walk in the Bay Avenue Mall. (Our target audience are residence of Executive Towers.
